// Frame protocol: every QR frame is fully self-describing, so there is NO
// handshake — the receiver locks onto a stream mid-flight, and a new session
// id on any frame simply starts a fresh transfer.
//
// Layout (little-endian), 22 bytes, followed by `blockLen` payload bytes:
//   0  u8   magic 0xD1  ┐ together: "this is a Decimen frame at all"
//   1  u8   magic 0xC3  ┘ magic1 is fixed forever; 0x0C/0x0D mark v1/v2
//   2  u8   version     wire format version — 3 (see WIRE_VERSION)
//   3  u8   flags       feature bits WITHIN a version (see FLAG_*)
//   4  u16  sessionId   random per sender start
//   6  u32  seq         drives the fountain PRNG (see fountain.ts)
//  10  u16  k           source block count
//  12  u16  blockLen    payload bytes per frame
//  14  u32  totalLen    protected file-container length in bytes
//  18  u32  payloadFnv  FNV-1a of the whole container — verified on completion
//
// Why bytes 0–3 look like this (v2 → v3, the whole point of this format break):
//
// v1 → v2 spent a break on the magic bump 0x0C → 0x0D and bought no version
// field with it. `parseFrame` returned null on an unknown magic and the
// receiver silently did nothing, so a version-mismatched stream looked
// identical to bad lighting. That is survivable for a PWA, which reconverges
// on a service-worker refresh within days of a release. It is NOT survivable
// once store binaries are in the field: those update on the user's schedule,
// weeks or never, and a silent break strands real installs.
//
// So, from v3 on:
//
//   - TWO magic bytes answer "is this ours at all", and they answer it BEFORE
//     anything is said about versions. One byte is not enough to speak on: with
//     a lone 0xD1 gate, ~1 binary QR payload in 256 falls through to the
//     version branches and gets told to update a device that has never run
//     Decimen — and that advice latches (see verdictShown in receive/main.ts),
//     so a wrong guess stays on screen until a real frame clears it. 16 bits of
//     magic is what makes the verdicts below trustworthy enough to show a user.
//   - `version` (byte 2) gates parsing wholesale, and a receiver that does not
//     recognise it says so out loud (classifyFrame → frameVerdictMessage).
//     0x0C and 0x0D stay reserved as MAGIC1 values forever, precisely so a v3
//     receiver can name a v1/v2 sender instead of shrugging at it.
//   - `flags` (byte 3) gates orthogonal features within a version, split into
//     must-understand and ignorable halves (see CRITICAL_FLAGS). That split has
//     to ship with the first versioned build: a receiver that treats every
//     unknown bit as fatal cannot be taught otherwise without another format
//     break, so "some bits are safe to ignore" is not a rule that can be added
//     later — only declared now.
//
// There is deliberately NO reserved byte. An earlier draft of v3 kept one and
// spent magic1 to pay for it, which had it backwards: a reserved byte only
// duplicates what a must-understand flag bit already does (and four of those is
// more headroom than this format will ever need), while magic1 duplicates
// nothing. Worse, that draft classified a nonzero reserved byte as `malformed`,
// which is silent — so the one mechanism it was spent on could never have been
// used without reintroducing the exact failure v3 exists to abolish.
//
// Deployed v2 receivers match byte 1 against 0x0D exactly, so they reject v3
// frames on the magic check rather than misparsing a header whose fields have
// all moved.
