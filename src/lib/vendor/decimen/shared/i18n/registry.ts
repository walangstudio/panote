// The locale control panel: every language Decimen ships, in one table.
//
// This file is deliberately tiny and dependency-free — it rides in every
// entry chunk (the language switcher needs each locale's native name without
// loading twelve catalogs), and the build imports it to know which page trees
// to emit. The catalogs themselves load on demand (see index.ts loaders).
//
// To add a language: add a row here, add shared/i18n/locales/<code>.ts
// (copy en.ts and translate it), and add its loader in index.ts. The build
// emits its /<code>/ page tree, sitemap entries, hreflang links, and PWA
// manifest from this table; nothing else needs touching.
//
// `reviewed` is the one flag a native-speaker review flips: while false, the
// pages carry a small footer note in that language saying the translation is
// machine-drafted and inviting a GitHub issue (see unreviewed-notice in
// index.ts). English is reviewed by construction — it is the source text.
